## 🏆 Featured "Buchalka Challenges"

Tim's course is known for comprehensive coding exercises. Here are my implementations of the major course projects:

### 🍔 **1. Bill's Burgers (OOP Master Challenge)**
* **Concept:** A complex exercise testing the pillars of OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation).
* **Goal:** Manage a burger shop's menu, creating standard burgers and healthy burgers with different topping limits and pricing.
* **My Solution:** Used **Composition** over Inheritance to manage toppings flexibly.
* [View Code](./OOP-Part2/BillsBurgers)

### 📱 **2. Mobile Phone (ArrayList Challenge)**
* **Concept:** Data manipulation using `ArrayList`.
* **Goal:** Create a simple contact manager that can add, update, remove, and query contacts.
* **My Solution:** Implemented validation logic to prevent duplicate entries.
* [View Code](./Arrays-Lists/MobilePhone)

### 🎵 **3. The Playlist (Inner Classes)**
* **Concept:** Using Inner Classes and LinkedLists.
* **Goal:** Create a song playlist that allows skipping forward/backward, preventing infinite loops in the iterator.
* [View Code](./InnerClasses/Playlist)

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Snippets

* **Primitive vs Reference:** Understanding how Java handles memory in the Stack vs Heap.
* **The "Static" Keyword:** Why `public static void main` exists and when to use static fields/methods.
* **Boxing/Unboxing:** The automatic conversion between `int` and `Integer` (wrapper classes).
* **Interface Segregation:** Learning why coding to an interface (e.g., `List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();`) is better than coding to the implementation.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Language:** Java 17 (LTS)
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (The recommended IDE for the course)
* **Build System:** Standard Java Project / Maven
